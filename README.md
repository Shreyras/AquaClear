### ðŸŒŽ Problem Statement
The quality of water resources around the world has been **degrading rapidly**.  
Hence, **judicious use** and **efficient treatment** of water have become critical as water becomes scarcer.  

Our proposed **IoT-based system** aims to:
- **Enhance** water utilization in households
- **Prevent excess use** of Reverse Osmosis (RO)
- **Block highly contaminated water** from entering home water-storage systems

---

### ðŸ’¡ How It Works
The system uses **sensors** to measure the physical characteristics of water:
- **Temperature**
- **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)**

These readings are gathered by a **microcontroller** and displayed to users via a **smartphone app** ðŸ“±.

Depending on the **TDS value**, the system:
- Automatically **controls the water filtration** (choosing RO or Non-RO filters)
- **Manages the water-storage tank** accordingly
