IOT based water management system for home water supply


The quality of water resources available across the world have been degrading much faster than ever before. Therefore,
judicious use of water resources has become an important topic as these resources get evermore scarce. Moreover,
efficient treatment and utilization of these resources domestically is another factor to be considered. Our proposed IoTbased system aims to enhance the water utilization in households as in preventing excess use of Reverse Osmosis (RO)
and prevent highly contaminated water from entering the house water-storage. The system uses sensors which measure
physical characteristics of water â€“ its temperature and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) which is gathered by the
microcontroller and displayed to the user on a smartphone. Based on the value of TDS of water, the system automatically
controls the water filter system by directing unfiltered water to the suitable filter (RO or Non-RO) as well as controlling
the water-storage tank system.
